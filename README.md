# Taylor-series
This repository contains a Python script for computing and visualizing the Taylor polynomial of a given function. The script prompts the user for a function, the center point of the Taylor series, and the desired degree of the polynomial. It then calculates the Taylor polynomial and plots it alongside the original function for comparison.
